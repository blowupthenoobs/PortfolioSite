The project is not really complete, but I wanted to put up what I did manage to make before SOM finishes.

Just a silly little portfolio site I have big plans for. I have a custom MySQL thing that I haven’t yet integrated, so it’s not in the project, but all the other stuff is, though a lot of it isn’t really used on the main hosting location (Render.)
I built some temporary links to lead you to a reskin of the subnub/drive on github (https://github.com/subnub/myDrive) that I’ve made several tweaks to. I spent awhile trying to get link forwarding(?) working, but didn’t quite manage to do so, hence the temporary links.

If you wish to put the project on your computer, I’ve been a bit of a little gremlin in which I didn’t use the gitignore properly, so all the React/Vite stuff is in the repo, so as for setting it up, all you really need is to open the project on a linux based system (mac works here, I have no idea why it only works on linux, but it’s where I was gonna host it anyhow,) and then go into the terminal and write: npm run dev
Once you do that, the project should open to the portfolio site, however if you tinker with the App.jsx file, you can reconfigure it to go to the fake google drive.
